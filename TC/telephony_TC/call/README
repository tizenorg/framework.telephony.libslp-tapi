=================================================================================

1. The EMAIL Test Script directory (TestCases) includes:

	call/
		|-- README                                         ; This file
		`-- Unit                                           ; contains Unit TCs
		    |-- makefile
		    |-- tslist
		    `-- Unit test case source codes
	2 directories, 44 files
	

2. The $(TEST_ROOT) directory must includes following files:

	/$(TEST_ROOT)
		|-- tet_scen
		|-- tetbuild.cfg
		|-- tetclean.cfg
		`-- tetexec.cfg

*                                Preconditions                                  *
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  Before Testing Call Module, you should check the following conditions        |
=================================================================================

1. Prepare Three valid SIM cards .

2. One target phone and two other phones are required to create MO/MT Call.Two extra phones are required for SWAP, HOLD, CONFERENCE and SPLIT etc functioality.

3. Call waiting must be enabled if not then enable it manually.

4. Modify the mobile number
	- call_common.h [LINE 40]
	- Followings are the macro for mobile number customized as per the country.
		// Mobile numbers

                 #define MOB_NUM1     "+919999146715"   //Used for MO call creation. Change the number according to your country.
                 #define MOB_NUM2     "+919810971703"   //Used to divert a call to specified number. Change the number according to your country.
                 #define DTMF_STRING  "12345"        // User can change as per their choice	

5. During execution continuously watch the log file at Putty or whatever terminal used for target logging and as per the log instruction, user has to provide
   the MT call or disconnect the call.

         e,g.: log will be printed in the following fashion:


              /****************************************/ 
              Give a MT Call within 20 secs 
             /****************************************/

              If user sees this kind of log in putty or used terminal, user has to give a MT call within the specified time [e.g. 20 secs].
            
             /****************************************/ 
             As call is answered disconnect the call
            /****************************************/

            If user see this kind of log in putty or used terminal , user has to disconnect after the call is received[ Not through target but through end user phone]

            /****************************************/
            disconnect the call
           /****************************************/

	   If user see this kind of log in putty or used terminal , user has to disconnect in MO & MT scenario’s[ Not through target but through end user phone]

1. In order to ensure successful working of the Test Scripts, please ensure that all of the IPKG files are installed normally.
2. Testing Call Module can be executed under target system environment (not simulator).
