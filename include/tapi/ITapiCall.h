 /**
 * @brief  This function originates MO call setup. This is an asynchronous function. The function completes immediately and
 * call setup proceeds in background.
 *
 * This API makes Dbus method call to Telephony Sever and gets immediate feedback.
 * However it just means that the API request has been transfered to the CP successfully.
 * The actual operation result is being delivered in the corresponding event asynchronously.
 *
 * @par Sync (or) Async:
 * This is an Asynchronous API.
 *
 * @par Important Notes:
 * -  If call to tel_exe_call_mo() is successful, call handle and request ID are assigned by Telephony Server
 *     and returned to client by given Call Handle and Request Id parameters. MO call setup continues in
 *     background. There are multiple states involved in the call setup procedure. Upon request completion
 *     successful or not, various event notifications are sent to client along with data associated with event
 *     (Successful data or error information) based on the indication or response received at the Telephony Server.
 * -  Setting up Emergency call
 *     - when #TelCallType_t  is voice_call, voice call is setup unless dial_number parameter is an
 *     emergency number known to telephony FW (like 112 for all 2G and above, other numbers may operator
 *     specific or device configuration specific, so Telephony FW will read relevant SIM files and refer to internal
 *     configuration records). If an emergency number is passed and #TelCallType_t  is voice_call, Telephony
 *     FW shall setup emergency phone call.
 *     - When #TelCallType_t  is emergency call, emergency call is always set up.
 *

 *   - Request Id value can be any value from 0 to 255 if the API is returned successfully
 *   - -1 (INVALID_REQUEST_ID) will be sent in case of failure.
 *
 * @par Async Response Message:
 * TAPI_EVENT_CALL_SETUP_CNF is sent to the application when the lower layers get the call originate response.
 * Asynchronous return status is indicated by #TelCallCause_t and call handle is sent in the event data.
 * Various asynchronous indications are described in the unsolicited notifications section . [Refer, \ref page8]
